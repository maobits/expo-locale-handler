# React Native Translation Control Demo

This demo project allows controlling translations in a React Native application. It utilizes the `i18next` library for internationalization and provides a language switcher to toggle between English and Spanish.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the application in your local environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maobits/expo-locale-handler.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd expo-locale-handler.git
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Once installations are complete, you can run the application on an emulator or connected device. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server and provide you with options to run the application on an emulator, physical device, or web.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you'll see a welcome screen with a button to switch between English and Spanish. Clicking on either of the buttons will change the language of the application according to the selection.
